# Promotion log — `src/icytower/`

One row per game function recovered into this directory (win32_pilot.md
SS7a/SS7b), in promotion order. "Offline result" is the outcome of
`carrier/lift/harness/lift_check.py --form src --vectors 20000` (unicorn on
the ORIGINAL bytes vs. `harness/src_check.exe`, compiled straight from this
directory) plus one negative-control byte-flip per function; full detail is
in `artifacts/src_equivalence.json`. "Carrier bind" is the win32_pilot.md
SS3 entry-patch step (original address -> this form) — **not attempted by
this log**; every row below is offline-verified only, per `src/README.md`
SS"Offline verification before anything is bound".

## Batch 1 (earlier pass)

| function | VA | size | CU | offline result | notes | carrier bind |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| `update_frame` | 0x406ac4 | 120 | main.c | EQUAL (20000) | zero x87, zero callees | pending |
| `is_solid` | 0x4166dc | 107 | map.c | EQUAL (20000) | pure predicate, negative-control-friendly (no writes) | pending |

## Batch 2 (this pass — win32_pilot.md scale test)

| function | VA | size | CU | offline result | notes | carrier bind |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| `jump_player` | 0x418678 | 198 | player.c | **EQUAL** (20000, `double`) | x87 HYPOTHESIS case per win32_pilot.md SS3, but its only FP ops (`sx+sx`, `sx*-2.0`, comparisons) are exact under any x87 precision — the LIFTED form already proved `double` sufficient here (carrier/lift/README.md SS6b), confirmed again for this independently-recovered source. Recovered by hand-tracing the x87 register-stack traffic in the disassembly (`fld`/`fxch`/`fucom`/`fstp` sequence); resisted quick readability — required working out that "keep ST(0), drop ST(1)" is `fstp st(1)`'s actual effect (easy to misread as the reverse) before the branch structure made sense. | pending |
| `getFloorData` | 0x416770 | 107 | map.c | EQUAL (20000) | pure integer row lookup, same `y = 29-((cy+1)>>4)` idiom as `is_solid`; reuses its already-verified `% 16` sign idiom for the offset | pending |
| `reset_map` | 0x4166a4 | 53 | map.c | EQUAL (20000) | smallest candidate; `empty` is set to -1, not 0 (promotion_candidates.md's "zero-fills" description was INFERRED and slightly imprecise — verified now) | pending |
| `add_combo` | 0x40414c | 62 | game_data.c | EQUAL (20000) | original writes 3 struct fields via 3 separate stores (re-reading `comboPosts` between each); simplified to one struct assignment (`Tgd_combo` has no padding, so this is bit-identical, not just equivalent) — the only case this pass where the clean form deliberately diverges from the disassembly's literal instruction sequence | pending |
| `line_intersect` | 0x406b80 | 302 | main.c | **DIFFER** (997/20000 census, `EAX`+`*px`+`*py` domain) | the win32_pilot.md SS6a x87 escalation case. Recovered faithfully (same operation order as the original: `ua`/`ub` kept in local `double`s, range-checked, then `(int)(ua*dx1+0.5)` truncated) and cross-checked against the already-offline-verified `carrier/lift/lifted/lifted_line_intersect.c`. Offline check under plain MSVC `cl.exe` (no `/arch` override) DIFFERs on ~5% of vectors — the exact same fidelity gap the LIFTED form hit under `pf_x87_t=double` (README SS6b: 107-128/50000), because this function keeps every FP intermediate in the x87 register stack and needs genuine 80-bit precision. This is a **build-configuration gap, not a source-recovery gap** (win32_pilot.md SS6a already names the fix: a real 80-bit x87 build, e.g. GCC `-mfpmath=387`, or binding the software 80-bit backend) — promoted with this caveat rather than skipped. | **pending a bit-exact build config**; do not bind at 0x406b80 until re-verified EQUAL under one |
| `get_gamepad` | 0x4017fc | 10 | control.c | EQUAL (20000, trivial — 0 args) | `return &gamepad;` — address-free because the compiler computes the address, no literal appears in source | pending |
| `is_up` | 0x401844 | 22 | control.c | EQUAL (20000) | one of 8 `Tcontrol.flags` bit-test predicates, see below | pending |
| `is_down` | 0x40185c | 22 | control.c | EQUAL (20000) | " | pending |
| `is_left` | 0x401874 | 17 | control.c | EQUAL (20000) | " | pending |
| `is_right` | 0x401888 | 22 | control.c | EQUAL (20000) | " | pending |
| `is_fire` | 0x4018a0 | 22 | control.c | EQUAL (20000) | " | pending |
| `is_pause` | 0x4018b8 | 22 | control.c | EQUAL (20000) | " | pending |
| `is_enter` | 0x4018d0 | 22 | control.c | EQUAL (20000) | " | pending |
| `is_any` | 0x4018e8 | 22 | control.c | EQUAL (20000) | tests every bit except `CTRL_PAUSE` (mask `~0x40`) | pending |

`is_up`..`is_any` (all in `src/icytower/control.c`): `Tcontrol.flags` (an
`unsigned char`, DWARF-confirmed but with no bitfield names — game_types.h
has only the raw byte) packs one bit per direction/action. The bit
assignment (`CTRL_LEFT=0x01` .. `CTRL_PAUSE=0x40`) was **not** recoverable
from DWARF; it was read off each function's `and eax, <mask>` in
`artifacts/disasm.txt`, one mask per function — the only construct in this
CU that resisted full DWARF-backed recovery. All eight return the x86
"boolean as -1/0" idiom (all-bits-set for true), not 0/1, confirmed by the
offline check.

## Skipped this pass

| function | VA | size | CU | why skipped |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `play_jump_sound` | 0x406ecc | 141 | main.c | Two independent reasons, either alone sufficient: **(1)** its real comparison domain, per `notes/promotion_candidates.md` SS4.3, is "which of 3 sound-handle values reached the downstream `play_sound()` call" — a call-trace comparison, not a memory-domain one, and `carrier/lift/harness/lift_check.py` only does memory-domain diffing; extending it to trace calls is new harness machinery, out of scope for an additive per-function spec. **(2)** the 3 sound-handle globals it reads (VAs 0x4fabf4/0x4fabf8/0x4fabfc) have no DWARF-recovered name (confirmed against `carrier/gen/interop_index.json`'s full 156-global list) — `src/` cannot declare an address-free extern for them without inventing a name and a binding outside the generated pipeline (`carrier/gen/gen_bindings.py` only emits bindings for names already in `interop_index.json`). Both are "the harness cannot model this domain" in the sense win32_pilot.md's task brief anticipates; not attempted. |

```

No function promoted this pass calls an Allegro import directly, so the
`/FIcarrier\gen\pf_lib_bindings.h` question from the task brief did not
arise; `play_sound` (a game function, not Allegro) already has a prototype
in the generated `game_funcs.h` and would need no special handling if
`play_jump_sound` is revisited later.
